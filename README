This plugin will add the script for Google Analytics (GA) in the <head> part of
your Question2Answer installation.

The only configurable part is in the "Plugins" section on the Admin interface.
To start using GA, just copy your tracking code from Google Analytics and paste it in the text box.
There's also possibility to disable tracking of Super Administrator's activities on the site.
